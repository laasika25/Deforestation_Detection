I added the following plots to better understand the fire incident data:

Pie Chart: Shows the percentage of each fire type to visualize category-wise distribution.

Box Plot: Displays how confidence levels vary across fire types and helps spot outliers.

Heatmap: Highlights correlations between numerical features like confidence, latitude, etc.

These plots make the dataset easier to explore and analyze visually.
